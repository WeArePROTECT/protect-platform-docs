# Platforms
This directory documents platforms that consume PROTECT data and metadata. Each platform is described in terms of purpose, data handled, stage (initial/prototype), and links to the source repository.

## Documented Platforms

- **[GenomeDepot](genomedepot/)** — Web-based platform for storing, browsing, and exploring isolate/genome data and annotations for PROTECT
- **[ASMA Prototype](asma-prototype/)** — R&D prototype and vision testbed for exploring multi-omic and isolate data browsing, linking, and exploration concepts
