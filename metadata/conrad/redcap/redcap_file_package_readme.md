# REDCap File Package README

**Last updated:** January 26, 2026

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This README documents the set of files shared by **Dahen Ibarra Munoz (Conrad / UCSD team)** as part of the rollout and evaluation of a new REDCap database for the PROTECT project.

These files were reviewed to:
- Understand the scope and structure of the new REDCap database
- Compare the new REDCap design against prior (unimplemented) REDCap plans
- Clarify which metadata fields are included, excluded, or refactored
- Establish expectations for downstream use within PROTECT (e.g., ASMA, GenomeDepot, analytics)

This document serves as **contextual documentation only**. It does not define schema requirements or governance policy; those are captured separately.

## 2. File Inventory

The following files were provided by Dahen and reviewed as part of this analysis:

### 2.1 `REDCap Field Specification EDITS Version 1.16.2026.xlsx`

**Source:** Conrad / UCSD team (Dahen Ibarra Munoz)  
**Purpose:** Annotated REDCap field specification reflecting the *current* REDCap prototype

This spreadsheet represents the working REDCap field specification and includes color-coded annotations indicating how each field is treated.

**Color legend used in the file:**
- **Green:** Field is included in the REDCap database (data to be collected)
- **Orange:** Field is intentionally excluded from REDCap
  - Either already shared via PROTECT server spreadsheets, or
  - UCSD-only data not intended for REDCap or PROTECT-wide use
- **Yellow:** Multiple legacy fields being merged (same date / semantics)
- **Blue:** Newly created REDCap field resulting from merged yellow fields

This file is the **primary design artifact** describing what data REDCap is intended to hold.

---

### 2.2 `PROTECT_DATA_LABELS_2026-01-23_1203 (LABELS).csv`

**Source:** REDCap export generated by Dahen  
**Purpose:** Example REDCap data export for review and validation

This CSV file is a **labels-based export** (human-readable field labels rather than raw variable names). It contains test / placeholder data and was generated to demonstrate:
- How REDCap data would appear when exported
- Field naming and labeling conventions
- How merged or refactored fields present in practice

This file is intended for **preview and evaluation only**, not for analysis or ingestion.

---

### 2.3 `REDCap Field Specification Version 7.10.2025.xlsx - Field Specification (1).csv`

**Source:** Original PROTECT planning document (authored prior to REDCap implementation)  
**Purpose:** Historical reference for earlier REDCap planning

This file captures the **originally planned REDCap schema** developed in 2025. It was never implemented in REDCap at the time, as the team opted not to proceed with REDCap then.

It is included here solely for:
- Historical comparison
- Understanding how metadata expectations evolved
- Explaining why certain fields now live outside REDCap

This file should **not** be interpreted as an active or expected schema.

---

## 3. Summary of Key Findings from File Review

Reviewing these files together established that:

- The new REDCap database is **clinical / EHR-focused only**
- Sample-handling and wet-lab metadata are **intentionally excluded** from REDCap
- Several legacy fields were **merged or refactored** for simplicity
- Some data elements are **UCSD-internal** and not shared with PROTECT

These conclusions informed the creation of a separate PROTECT metadata README documenting the final architecture.

## 4. Email Context from Dahen Ibarra Munoz

The following emails accompanied the shared files and provide important context.

---

### Email 1: REDCap Prototype and Field Specification

> Hello, Spencer.
>
> I have completed a preliminary prototype database in RedCap for the PROTECT expanded metadata/clinical data.
>
> While building this database, a few changes have been made to the REDCap Field Specifications we had talked about before. In this email I am attaching two excel spreadsheets.
>
> The "EDITS Version 1.16.2026" spreadsheet has different colored highlights. Here's what the highlights mean:
> - Green: Included in the database (data to be collected)
> - Orange: This data is not included in the database. This is either because this data is already being shared through the spreadsheet in the servers (see comments in column B), or it's UCSD only data that does not need to go into RedCap.
> - Yellow: We are merging these yellow highlighted fields into a single field in RedCap. The date for yellow fields will always be the same.
> - Blue: This is the newly created field (from merging the yellow fields)
>
> I have also attached a clean version of the REDCap Field Specification spreadsheet that lists the final RedCap fields.
>
> I will play with the database and add fake data to do a data export and share with you once I have it to get your thoughts.
>
> Please let me know if you have any comments or if further clarification is needed.
>
> Best,
> Dahen Ibarra Munoz

### Email 2: REDCap Data Export Example

> Hello Spencer,
>
> I took some time to add data to the REDCap database and completed a data export to see how it would look.
>
> I am attaching the excel file produced by the REDCap data export; this is a "labels" data export (not raw data export).
>
> Please let me know if you have any comments, suggestions, or questions. I need to analyze this a bit more to see if I need to add more options to some of the fields, especially for occasions where we don't have data available from the patient's EHR. Also, let me know if it would be a good idea to add you to the project in REDCap so that you can take a deeper look.
>
> Thank you and have a great weekend,
> Dahen Ibarra Munoz

## 5. How These Files Should Be Used

- These files provide **design and context**, not authoritative production schemas
- REDCap field inclusion/exclusion decisions should be referenced from the *latest* REDCap documentation
- This package is primarily intended for:
  - Internal review
  - Historical record
  - Onboarding and knowledge transfer
